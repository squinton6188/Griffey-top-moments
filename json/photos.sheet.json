Griffey, though, quickly eased those worries when he hit a home run at Minnesota on opening day to tie Frank Robinson for the most opening-day home runs in major-league history (if only that had been his last opening day with the Mariners).\n\n",

He shouldn’t have been as he was wildly cheered at every turn and responded with a turn-back-the-clock performance when he hit two home runs in the last game of the series on June 24, 2007.\n\n",

It was the first walk-off homer of Griffey’s career and sparked the rally that saw Seattle overtake the Angels in the West.",

Not that Griffey would have stopped, but if he had, it might have been left to a rookie named Alex Rodriguez, who was waiting on deck, to drive him in. That the play instead is remembered as the greatest moment for maybe the two greatest Mariners of all time — Edgar Martinez and Griffey — makes it a rare Mariner moment that turned out, and remains, perfect.",
